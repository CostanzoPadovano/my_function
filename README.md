# Analysis Project Folder Structure

This repository provides a Bash script (`Create_base_analysis_folders.sh`) to set up a standardized folder structure for organizing analysis projects. The script creates directories for data, notebooks, scripts, reports, and results, along with essential files like `environment.yml` and `README.md`.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Script:**
   - Download the `Create_base_analysis_folders.sh` script to your computer.
   - Save the script in a directory where you want to create a new analysis project folder.

2. **Give Execute Permission:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
   - Run the following command to give execute permission to the script:

```bash
chmod +x Create_base_analysis_folders.sh
```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - In the terminal, execute the script by providing a project name as an argument:

```bash
./Create_base_analysis_folders.sh <project_name>
```

Replace `<project_name>` with the desired name of your analysis project. For example:

```bash
./Create_base_analysis_folders.sh MyAnalysisProject
```

4. **Folder Structure:**
   - After running the script, a new folder named `MyAnalysisProject` (or the project name you provided) will be created in the current directory.
   - Inside this folder, you'll find the standardized analysis project structure, including subdirectories for data, notebooks, scripts, reports, results, and the environment file (`environment.yml`) for reproducibility.

5. **Customization:**
   - Feel free to customize the script or modify the folder structure to suit your specific needs.
   - You can add default content to the `README.md` file or include additional directories as required.

## Example

Suppose you want to create a new analysis project named "MyAnalysisProject." Follow the steps below:

1. Download the script to your computer.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Give execute permission to the script:

```bash
chmod +x Create_base_analysis_folders.sh
```

4. Run the script with the project name:

```bash
./Create_base_analysis_folders.sh MyAnalysisProject
```

5. You'll find a new folder named `MyAnalysisProject` with the analysis project structure inside.
